</div>

<div class="container text-white">
    <div class="row">
        <p class="text-white">We recognize and are grieved by the deterioration in discourse, both in the general 
            public and in Christian communities. This deterioration is particularly extreme whenever political or social 
            issues are discussed. In particular, we observer the following serious problems: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lack of Charity</li>
            <li>Lack of Sympathy</li>
            <li>Tribalism</li>
            <li>Fear Mongering</li>
            <li>Conscious and Subconscious Acceptance that Truth is Relative</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-white">
            We also recognize that our current Information Age makes it increasingly complex to search, navigate and 
            identify trust-worthy, high quality resources to better understand and approach difficult subjects as Christians. 
            We see a critical need for strong and loving shepherding on 
            how we ought to sort through the barrage of noise fighting for our attention and money.

<div class="container text-white">
    <div class="row">
        <p class="text-white">To promote individuals whose discourse demonstrates a commitment to the Christian faith and 
            exemplifies The Great Requirement. We share high quality discussions focused on Christian embodiment of the 
            Great Requirement ethic in social and civic life: locally, nationally and globally. </p>
        <p class="text-white">We are committed to investing time and effort towards identifying and promoting 
            Christian resources and voices we feel confident will encourage growth, love and sanctification. 
            We strive to amplify voices that speak to difficult issues and exemplify the following qualities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Honesty</li>
            <li>Humility</li>
            <li>Hope</li>

<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <p class="text-white">Great Requirement Discourse was born through many conversations between a 
            father and son about the things they were learning from Christian leaders through great Podcasts. 
            These conversations were a bright spot during a difficult year and planted the desire to share about 
            the people and resources who were speaking truth and spurring growth in their Christian walk.

            Furthermore, the spirit of Great Requirement Discourse is fundamentally in opposition to the spirit of confirmation bias. We 
            recognize that ALL people have unique experiences, perspectives, and biases. We believe that God has called us
            to be life-long learners in a process of continual growth, turning away from sin, and becoming
            more and more like Jesus Christ through a process of sanctification. We do not believe that any person
            or institution promoted by Great Requirement Discourse has achieved perfect knowledge or infallibility. We do believe
            that they are admirable examples who earnestly seek God and promote the advancement of the great requirement in good faith
            worth truly listening to and learning from.
